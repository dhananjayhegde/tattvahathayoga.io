Back in 2016, Ramya was an IT professional when she attended her first Hatha Yoga classes in Isha Foundation, Coimbatore.  Since then, there was no looking back for her.  If there is one thing she is devoted to, that is her Yoga practices.  She attended other advanced Programs in the IshaYoga Center, till she came across Hatha Yoga Teacher Training Program.

At once, she decided that that is what she wanted to do. In 2018, she attended a 21 week, 1750 hrs long teacher training program.  In her own words, those were one of the best days of her life and she wouldn’t exchange it with anything; most trans-formative 21-weeks. When she went there, getting certified was least of her worries.  All she wanted was to soak in her practices, explore more of what this is. 

As she says, she was one person who never woke up to look at a sunrise.  8 o’Clock was “early morning” for her.  Since starting the teacher training program, and even after completing it, 4 AM has become her new 8 AM.  She is a morning person!

Since completing her training, she has taught yoga to kids and elders in various places across Bangalore.  She worked with Mukul anna, founder of Yogire.com.

Her mission is to make ‘Yoga For All’ a REALITY.

Start your journey today and become the master of your own life. .
